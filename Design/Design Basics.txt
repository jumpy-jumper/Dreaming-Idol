Unit Creation    
    Player can create new units from scratch using their own graphic.
    Units have a variety of attributes that help them succeed in adventure.
    Units can specialize in various skills.
    The maximum number of units is small.
Adventure
    Units can be deployed to various places in the world.
    Every _ frames, the adventure world ticks and the unit performs an action.
    Each world has their own tick rate
    Units can battle, gather, craft, explore, or bond with other units
    Actions are automated based on the unit's gambits (the player can't control units directly)
Worlds
    Each world has their own characteristics that require particular approaches from the player's units
    Units can be deployed to one world at a time
    When the player defeats the final boss of world n, they can deploy units to world n+1, a buffed version of the world
    Buffed worlds provide better rewards
Shrines
    Each world has their own god watching over them
    The player can nerf worlds by giving something up to the world's god
Gambits

    The main gambit describes what the unit will do every tick
        Look for enemies, look for gathering nodes, look to craft, look to bond
Bonding
    Units can bond with other units
Equipment
    Units have equipment slots.
Abilities
    Units have ability slots.
Rebirth
    Units can be Reborn as a different unit
