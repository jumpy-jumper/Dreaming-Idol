- Realize the idea that an idle game is most fun when you have something cool to come back to after idling.
- Optimization exists just below a level of complexity that is unreasonable to model.
- The optimal choice is independent of whether the player will play or idle.
    (the game is always "Idle-Ready" and "Play-Ready" after an atomic play-action)
- The player will play or idle based on desire, not optimality.
- Satisfying RPG-like growth of player-created units.
- Avoid using position as a mechanical element.
